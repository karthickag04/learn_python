## üìö Learning Path - Course Contents

### üìñ Core Python Concepts

#### Fundamentals (Start Here!)
- **01_helloworld.py** üéØ  
  Your first Python program! This script demonstrates the classic "Hello, World!" program, which is often the first step in learning any programming language. It shows how to use the `print()` function to display output and includes a simple arithmetic example. The file is heavily commented to explain the syntax, the use of string literals, and the purpose of the print function in Python.

- **02_comments.py**  
  This file explains how to write comments in Python, covering both single-line comments (using `#`) and multi-line comments (using triple quotes). It discusses why comments are important for code documentation and how they can be used to annotate or temporarily disable code during development.

- **03_variables.py**  
  This script introduces variables in Python, showing how to assign values, use variables in expressions, and print results. It covers naming conventions, best practices for choosing variable names, and highlights Python's reserved keywords (with a list included in the comments). The file also provides tips for writing clear, maintainable code using variables.

- **04_datatypes.py**  
  This file explores Python's fundamental data types, including integers, floats, strings (both single-line and multi-line), booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and the special `None` type. It demonstrates how to create, access, and modify these types, and explains the concepts of mutability and immutability. The script also shows how to check the type of a variable using the `type()` function.

#### Operators & Decision Making
- **05_py_operators.ipynb**  
  This Jupyter notebook provides a hands-on introduction to Python operators. It covers arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators, with code cells and markdown explanations.

- **05a_py_operators.ipynb**  
  This notebook organizes all major Python operators into categories: arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, bitwise, identity, membership, and ternary. Each operator is listed in a Python list with comments describing its function. This file serves as a quick reference or summary of Python's operator syntax and usage.

- **06_Conditional.ipynb**  
  This notebook introduces conditional statements in Python, including `if`, `elif`, and `else` constructs. It demonstrates how to use logical operators within conditions and introduces the `match` statement for pattern matching (available in recent Python versions). The notebook provides practical code examples for decision making and branching logic in Python programs.
