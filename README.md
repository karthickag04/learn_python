## Python Basics

This session introduces fundamental Python concepts for beginners. Each file or notebook is designed to be self-contained, with code examples, comments, and explanations to help you understand the basics of Python programming.

### Contents

- **01_helloworld.py**  
  This script demonstrates the classic "Hello, World!" program, which is often the first step in learning any programming language. It shows how to use the `print()` function to display output and includes a simple arithmetic example. The file is heavily commented to explain the syntax, the use of string literals, and the purpose of the print function in Python.

- **02_comments.py**  
  This file explains how to write comments in Python, covering both single-line comments (using `#`) and multi-line comments (using triple quotes). It discusses why comments are important for code documentation and how they can be used to annotate or temporarily disable code during development.

- **03_variables.py**  
  This script introduces variables in Python, showing how to assign values, use variables in expressions, and print results. It covers naming conventions, best practices for choosing variable names, and highlights Python's reserved keywords (with a list included in the comments). The file also provides tips for writing clear, maintainable code using variables.

- **04_datatypes.py**  
  This file explores Python's fundamental data types, including integers, floats, strings (both single-line and multi-line), booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and the special `None` type. It demonstrates how to create, access, and modify these types, and explains the concepts of mutability and immutability. The script also shows how to check the type of a variable using the `type()` function.

- **05_py_operators.ipynb**  
  This Jupyter notebook provides a hands-on introduction to Python operators. It covers arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators, with code cells and markdown explanations. Each operator is demonstrated with practical examples, and the notebook includes explanations of how and when to use each type of operator in Python code.

- **05a_py_operators.ipynb**  
  This notebook organizes all major Python operators into categories: arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, bitwise, identity, membership, and ternary. Each operator is listed in a Python list with comments describing its function. This file serves as a quick reference or summary of Python's operator syntax and usage.

- **06_Conditional.ipynb**  
  This notebook introduces conditional statements in Python, including `if`, `elif`, and `else` constructs. It demonstrates how to use logical operators within conditions and introduces the `match` statement for pattern matching (available in recent Python versions). The notebook provides practical code examples for decision making and branching logic in Python programs.

- **07_data_structures_in_python.ipynb**  
  This Jupyter notebook provides a comprehensive introduction to Python's built-in data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. It covers how to create, access, and modify each data structure, demonstrates their unique properties (such as mutability and immutability), and provides practical examples for each. The notebook also lists and explains common methods and operations for each data structure, including nested and mixed-type collections. Students will find hands-on code cells and explanations to help them understand how to use these data structures effectively in Python programming.

Each script or notebook is self-contained and includes comments or markdown to help you understand the code and concepts. This session is ideal for beginners who want a structured, example-driven introduction to Python programming.
