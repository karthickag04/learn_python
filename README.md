## Session 01: Python Basics

This session introduces fundamental Python concepts for beginners. Each file or notebook covers a specific topic with code examples and explanations.

### Contents

- **01_helloworld.py**  
  Introduces the classic "Hello, World!" program. Demonstrates how to print output and perform simple arithmetic in Python. Includes comments explaining the print function and string literals.

- **02_comments.py**  
  Explains how to write single-line and multi-line comments in Python. Shows the syntax for both types and discusses their use for code documentation and annotation.

- **03_variables.py**  
  Covers variable assignment, naming conventions, and best practices. Provides examples of variable usage, discusses reserved keywords, and lists Python's reserved words. Offers tips for clear and effective variable naming.

- **04_datatypes.py**  
  Demonstrates Python's basic data types: integers, floats, strings (single-line and multi-line), booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and the `None` type. Shows how to access, modify, and check the type of each variable. Includes examples of mutability and immutability.

- **05_py_operators.ipynb**  
  Notebook covering Python operators. Explains and demonstrates arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators with code examples and explanations in markdown and code cells.

- **05a_py_operators.ipynb**  
  Notebook listing all major Python operators by category: arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, bitwise, identity, membership, and ternary. Each operator is grouped and described in Python lists.

- **06_Conditional.ipynb**  
  Notebook introducing conditional statements in Python. Shows usage of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, logical operators, and the `match` statement for pattern matching. Includes practical code examples for decision making.
