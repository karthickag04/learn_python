# The code above defines three variables: x, y, and z.
# The variables x and y are assigned the values 10 and 20, respectively.
# The variable z is assigned the sum of x and y, which is 30.
# Finally, the value of z is printed to the console, resulting in the output 30.

# In Python, variables are used to store data values.
# A variable is created by assigning a value to it using the equals sign (=).
# The variable name can be any combination of letters, numbers, and underscores, but it cannot start with a number.
# Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that "myVariable" and "myvariable" would be considered different variables.
# For example, you can assign an integer value to a variable and later assign a string value to the same variable.



# 1. Use descriptive names: Choose variable names that clearly describe the purpose of the variable. For example, use "age" instead of "a" or "x".

# 2. Use lowercase letters: Variable names should be written in lowercase letters, with words separated by underscores 
# (e.g., "my_variable").

# 3. Avoid using reserved keywords: Do not use Python reserved keywords (e.g., "if", "else", "while") as variable names.

# 4. Use meaningful abbreviations: If you need to use abbreviations, make sure they are commonly understood (e.g., "num" for "number").

# 5. Avoid using special characters: Variable names should only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. Avoid using spaces or special characters (e.g., @, #, $, %).

# 6. Use camelCase or snake_case: Choose a naming style (camelCase or snake_case) and stick to it. For example, "myVariable" (camelCase) or "my_variable" (snake_case).

# 7. Avoid using single-letter variable names: Unless in a loop or mathematical context, avoid using single-letter variable names (e.g., "x", "y", "z") as they can be unclear.

# 8. Use underscores for readability: If a variable name consists of multiple words, use underscores to separate them (e.g., "total_price" instead of "totalprice").
